# Predesigned Qt GUIs

Me having fun in Qt designer or messing around in QML or whatever. This repos is going to be just a hodgepodge of random stuff. Dig through it as you please.

These also use KDE's Framework 5, which is also open source

## Interfaces:

1. **Account setup:** a basic interface to set up a company account on a server. Can be customized.
2. **Installation wizard:** an installer wizard with options for Windows users and those who don't like package managers
